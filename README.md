`react-aptform` is a library to work with forms in react efficiently. It aims for both DX and UX to make forms less tedious.

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-aptform
```

Or with yarn:
```sh
yarn add react-aptform
```

The package expects at least `react@16.0.0`.

### Project goals

- practicality first
- well performant for reasonably small forms (< 30 inputs)
- specify common form behaviour declaratively
- API that doesn't go in your way

## Documentation

Docs lives in [`docs`](docs) directory of the repository.

Highlights:

- [**docs/API.md**](docs/API.md): documented components, their props and object shapes
- [**docs/guides.md**](docs/guides.md): how to use the package for different use cases
- [**docs/implementation.md**](docs/implementation.md): implementation decisions rationale to help you memorize the API

See it in action on [**deployed examples**](https://simonmares.github.io/react-aptform/) and also check the [**example sources**](examples).

Many edge cases are implemented in the [**tests in the repository**](tests).

## Features

**Functional**

- storing values of controlled inputs
- tracking input meta state (for custom UI e.g. to make UX better)
- consistent forms behaviour throughout your app (`preconfigure`)
- declarative input configuration allows consistent behavior of same inputs in different forms throughout your app
- validation framework (i18n friendly errors, suggestions on *showing* the validation error/success)
- submit framework (reset data on success, set server errors, managing submitting state)

**Non functional**

- no need for custom class components for inputs or forms
- does not render anything on its own neither it listens to DOM events
- provides mature input meta state modeling
- no setup needed (main component works out-of-box)
- flow typed

**Show validation insight**

API includes methods to show validation error / success based on custom configured rules in order to improve UX.

**i18n friendly validation**

Validation is boolean-based rather string-based, it makes i18n simpler and its less fragile.

**No actual rendering**

We provide behavioral components that only hook into React system, but leaves rendering up to a function you provide. This avoids e.g. styling problems. You have total control of how your inputs look.

### Use cases

- login and signup forms
- profile page
- any temporary forms (including custom input components)

For more complex use cases see below for **[Alternatives](#alternatives)**.

## Usage example

What you gain in this example by using the package:

- you know whether a **form is valid**
- you know whether an **input is valid**
- you have a **place to store input states** to leverage controlled inputs (you can use the current value however you want in render)
- you will **receive all the values** in a single object (`onSubmit`)
- you can set **default value for each input** with a single object

What you need to do:

- you must set all the required handlers on `form` and `input` components (you can leverage `getPassProps`)
- you must provide a configuration for an input if its required or has validation

Notes:

- `value`, `name` and `onChange` input props can be passed automatically with JSX expression `{...email.getPassProps()}`
- you can set form handlers automatically too with `{...form.getPassProps()}`

```js
  <Aptform
    initialValues={{
      name: 'Eliana RendÃ³n',
      email: 'eliana@example.com',
    }}
    onSubmit={values => {
      console.log('Name value: ', values.name);
      console.log('Email value: ', values.email);
    }}
    inputs={{
      name: { required: true },
      email: { validations: { isEmail: val => /@/.test(val) } },
    }}
    render={({ inputs, form }) => {
      const { name, email } = inputs;
      return (
        <form onBlur={form.onBlur} onFocus={form.onFocus} onSubmit={form.onSubmit}>
          <div>
            Name: <input type="text" value={name.value} name={name.name} onChange={name.onChange} />
          </div>
          <div>
            Email:
            <input type="email" value={email.value} name={email.name} onChange={email.onChange} />
          </div>
          <button type="submit" disabled={!form.isValid()}>
            Submit
          </button>
        </form>
      );
    }}
  />
```

## Limitations

- Typescript support (use Formik)
- React native support (use Formik)
- Nested fields (use Formik or `react-final-form`)

**Project constraints:**

- browser only
- no complex form solutions (nested, multi-step forms, ...)
- must be i18n-friendly
- conventions for common tasks (submit, validation)
- only one API
- enable great UX

## Alternatives

This library was inherently inspired by following react form solutions:

- https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik (declarative configuration, input states)
- https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form (input states, use cases in examples)
- https://github.com/vacuumlabs/react-custom-validation (show validation recommendation)
- https://github.com/christianalfoni/formsy-react (convenience)
- https://github.com/erikras/redux-form (input states)

The package was created a moment before Formik and `react-final-form` were released. They're both good and this package is definitely not "an order of magnitude better". I still use it because of simplicity (no duplicate API), i18n-friendliness and made conventions, so I don't have to think about how to implement forms over and over.
